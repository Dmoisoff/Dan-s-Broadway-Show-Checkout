# Danâ€™s Broadway Show Checkout

A demo front end that allows users to select a Broadway show, enter basic billing information, and checkout. Built for coding challenge over the weekend.

Upon successful checkout, the user is alerted that the checkout has been completed.

To simulate calls to a payment service and a backend, I have added two console logs. One logs the billing information and the other logs platform-related information that would be sent to the backend.
